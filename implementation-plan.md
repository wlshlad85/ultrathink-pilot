## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for Trading System Architectural Enhancement, including task breakdown, dependencies, resource allocation, and rollout strategy.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Design and implement unified data pipeline architecture
- [ ] Migrate SQLite experiments.db to TimescaleDB schema
- [ ] Set up Kafka cluster for event-driven messaging
- [ ] Develop Data Service with Redis caching layer
- [ ] Create feature engineering abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement backward-compatible data loading for existing models
- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for data pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement probabilistic regime detection with Dirichlet process mixture model
- [ ] Develop ensemble coordinator with weighted strategy blending
- [ ] Refactor specialist models to use unified data pipeline
- [ ] Implement MLflow experiment tracking integration
- [ ] Create model registry for checkpoint versioning
- [ ] Build Training Orchestrator service with resource management
- [ ] Set up A/B testing framework for model comparison
- [ ] Implement automated checkpoint cleanup and archival

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish
- [ ] Decouple forensics system into event-driven architecture
- [ ] Implement Kafka producer in trading decision path
- [ ] Build Forensics Consumer service for asynchronous processing
- [ ] Develop hierarchical RL meta-controller prototype
- [ ] Implement online learning pipeline with sliding window
- [ ] Add elastic weight consolidation for stability
- [ ] Create Inference Service API with low-latency requirements
- [ ] Set up circuit breakers and graceful degradation

## Resource Requirements

### Engineering
- **ml_engineers:** 2 FTE for model architecture, training pipeline, online learning
- **backend_engineers:** 1 FTE for infrastructure, APIs, database migration
- **devops_support:** 0.5 FTE for Kafka, monitoring, deployment automation

### Infrastructure
- **compute:** 2x GPU servers (NVIDIA A100 or equivalent) for concurrent training
- **database:** TimescaleDB cluster (3 nodes) with 1TB SSD storage
- **messaging:** Kafka cluster (3 brokers) with 500GB retention
- **cache:** Redis cluster (2 nodes) with 128GB memory
- **monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana stack

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Risk | TBD | High | Parallel operation with rigorous A/B testing, rollback capability |
| Risk | TBD | Critical | Comprehensive unit tests, data validation checks, comparison with existing pipeline |
| Risk | TBD | High | Conservative learning rates, automatic stability checks, checkpoint rollback |
| Risk | TBD | Critical | Full backup before migration, dual-write validation period, data integrity checks |

## Rollout Strategy

### Feature Flags
- unified_data_pipeline_enabled: control migration to new pipeline
- probabilistic_regime_detection_enabled: toggle new regime detection
- event_driven_forensics_enabled: enable Kafka-based forensics
- meta_controller_enabled: activate hierarchical RL strategy selection
- online_learning_enabled: toggle incremental model updates
- risk_manager_enabled: activate portfolio-level risk controls

### Rollout Phases
### Phase 1: Shadow mode: New system runs in parallel, no trading decisions used (2 weeks)

### Phase 2: Canary: 5% of trading decisions use new system (1 week)

### Phase 3: Partial: 25% of trading decisions use new system (2 weeks)

### Phase 4: Majority: 75% of trading decisions use new system (2 weeks)

### Phase 5: Full: 100% migration, old system deprecated (monitoring continues 4 weeks)


### Rollback Plan
Feature flag-based instant rollback to previous system, maintain parallel infrastructure for 8 weeks post-launch
