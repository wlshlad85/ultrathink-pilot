## Key Success: Regime-Aware Behavior

| Regime  | HOLD  | BUY   | SELL |
|---------|-------|-------|------|
| Bull    | 50%   | 50%   | 0%   |
| Neutral | 98%   | 2%    | 0%   |
| Bear    | 99.5% | 0%    | 0.5% |

The model learned to:
✓ Be aggressive in bull markets
✓ Be cautious in neutral markets  
✓ Avoid buying in bear markets

## Trade-off

SUCCESS: Eliminated catastrophic counter-trend buying (0% vs 42%)
CONCERN: Model is TOO conservative (-1.57% vs +1.03%)

The new model prevents large losses but misses some opportunities.
