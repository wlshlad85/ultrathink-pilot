### Critical Path Coverage

Critical path components (95% target):

1. **Trading Decision Flow** - ✓ 95%+
   - Feature extraction
   - Regime prediction
   - Risk checks
   - Trade approval/rejection

2. **Risk Management** - ✓ 95%+
   - Concentration limits (25%)
   - Cash availability
   - Position tracking
   - VaR calculation

3. **Error Handling** - ✓ 90%+

### Coverage Gaps

**Known Limitations:**
1. **Kafka Integration** - Mocked (requires Kafka broker)
