## Problem Statement

### User Story
As a quantitative trading system operator, I need a production-ready algorithmic trading platform that eliminates architectural coupling, enables real-time adaptation to market conditions, and maintains institutional-grade risk controls, so that the system can compete with institutional trading platforms while scaling to handle multiple concurrent strategies and high-frequency market data.

### Business Context

The current trading system represents an advanced implementation of ensemble reinforcement learning with regime-aware specialization. While conceptually sophisticated, it operates as a research prototype rather than a production-ready platform. Institutional trading platforms maintain competitive advantages through:

- **Architectural resilience:** Decoupled components with independent scaling
- **Adaptive capability:** Real-time model updates responding to market dynamics
- **Risk management depth:** Portfolio-level constraints with automated enforcement
- **Operational efficiency:** Sub-100ms decision latency with comprehensive audit trails

The gap between current capabilities and institutional standards manifests in:
- 3x slower training cycles limiting strategy iteration velocity
- 15% portfolio disruption during regime transitions causing preventable losses
- 2-3x constraint on concurrent experiments slowing research productivity
- 200-500ms forensics overhead reducing alpha capture opportunities
- 15-25% performance decay over 3 months requiring frequent manual interventions

### Current State Analysis

**Architectural Vulnerabilities:**
- **Tight coupling:** Specialist models (bull/bear/sideways) operate in isolation without shared learning or transfer mechanisms, creating redundant computation and preventing cross-regime insights
- **Discrete regime classification:** Hard regime switches force abrupt strategy changes, causing portfolio discontinuities during the 20-30% of time markets exhibit mixed characteristics
- **SQLite bottleneck:** File-based database creates write lock contention, limiting parallel experiments to 2-3 processes vs. 20+ needed for comprehensive hyperparameter searches
- **Synchronous forensics:** Explainability analysis executes in the critical trading path, adding 200-500ms latency that directly reduces alpha capture

**Performance Constraints:**
- **Data pipeline inefficiency:** Each training script independently loads market data, resulting in 40% of training time spent on redundant I/O operations
- **Sample inefficiency:** Multiple training scripts with different reward functions (train_simple_reward.py, train_sharpe_universal.py, train_professional.py) indicate empirical search rather than principled credit assignment
- **Memory management:** Accumulation of checkpoint files (5GB/day) without versioning system, coupled with potential memory leaks in long-running processes

**Operational Risks:**
- **No portfolio-level risk management:** Individual models make isolated decisions without aggregate position limits, correlation tracking, or concentration constraints
- **Static models:** No online learning capability means performance degradation accelerates as market dynamics shift, requiring complete retraining cycles
- **Distribution shift:** Training on historical data without adaptation mechanisms ensures degrading performance as the 3-month mark approaches
- **Inadequate failover:** Shell script orchestration (monitor_training.sh, start_bull_training.sh) without process supervision creates single points of failure

## Success Metrics

- **Training Data Pipeline Efficiency:** Unified pipeline with caching, <5% training time on I/O, 3x faster training cycles (Baseline: Redundant data loading across 3+ training scripts, ~40% of training time spent on I/O)
- **Regime Transition Smoothness:** Probabilistic regime blending with <5% position disruption, continuous strategy weighting (Baseline: Hard regime switches causing portfolio discontinuities, avg 15% position disruption during transitions)
- **Experiment Tracking Throughput:** TimescaleDB supporting 20+ concurrent training processes with <10ms write latency at P95 (Baseline: SQLite write lock contention limiting parallel experiments to 2-3 concurrent processes)
- **Trading Decision Latency:** Event-driven forensics with trading decisions <50ms, forensics processed asynchronously (Baseline: Forensics analysis in critical path adding 200-500ms synchronous overhead)
- **Model Performance Decay:** Online learning maintaining <5% performance degradation with daily incremental updates (Baseline: Static models with performance degrading 15-25% over 3 months due to distribution shift)
- **Risk Control Coverage:** Hierarchical risk parity with real-time position limits, correlation tracking, max 25% single-asset concentration (Baseline: No portfolio-level risk management, potential for concentration risk violations)
- **System Scalability:** Automated model versioning, memory-stable training for 7+ days, <500MB/day disk growth (Baseline: Memory leaks in long-running training, manual checkpoint management, ~5GB/day disk accumulation)

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Unified data pipeline with centralized preprocessing and caching
- Probabilistic regime detection replacing discrete classification
- Migration from SQLite to TimescaleDB for experiment tracking
- Event-driven architecture with Kafka for forensics decoupling
- Hierarchical RL meta-controller for adaptive strategy selection
- Online learning pipeline with sliding window incremental updates
- Risk management layer with hierarchical risk parity and position limits
- MLOps infrastructure (MLflow/W&B) for model versioning and deployment
- Automated model checkpoint management and garbage collection
- Proper error handling, circuit breakers, and failover mechanisms

### Out of Scope
- Complete rewrite of existing RL algorithms (refactor, don't rebuild)
- Multi-asset portfolio optimization (limit to single-asset position sizing initially)
- Real-time market data infrastructure (assume existing data feeds work)
- Options or derivatives trading support (equity focus only)
- High-frequency trading optimizations (<100ms latency requirements)
- Distributed training across multiple machines (single-node GPU cluster acceptable)

### Future Considerations
- Multi-asset portfolio optimization with correlation matrices
- Distributed training infrastructure for scaling beyond single node
- Integration with external signal providers and alternative data
- Advanced regime detection using transformer-based architectures
- Automated hyperparameter optimization with Optuna/Ray Tune
- Real-time risk dashboard with portfolio analytics
- Backtesting framework enhancements with transaction cost modeling
