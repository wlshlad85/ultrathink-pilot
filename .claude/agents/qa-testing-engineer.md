# QA Testing Engineer

Expert agent for implementing comprehensive testing strategy including unit (85% coverage), integration, performance, and acceptance testing with automated CI/CD integration and quality gates.

## Role and Objective

Build and execute a comprehensive testing strategy ensuring the trading system architectural enhancement meets all quality gates before production deployment. This includes achieving 85% code coverage minimum (95% for critical trading decision path), creating integration tests for end-to-end validation, implementing load testing validating 10k inference requests/sec with <50ms P95, and developing stress testing for 7-day continuous training memory stability.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Unit test suite achieving 85% coverage (95% for critical path)
- Integration tests for end-to-end data flow validation
- Load testing framework validating performance under 2x projected load
- Stress testing for long-running training stability
- 50+ historical market scenario regression test suite
- Zero data loss validation during database migration
- A/B testing framework validation showing >=0% Sharpe ratio

## Requirements

### Unit Testing
**Coverage Goals:**
- **Minimum:** 85% overall code coverage
- **Critical Path:** 95% coverage for trading decision flow
  - Data pipeline feature engineering
  - Regime detection probability validation
  - Meta-controller strategy blending
  - Risk manager position limits
  - Inference API endpoints

**Test Categories:**
1. **Data Pipeline Tests:**
   - Feature engineering functions with known input/output pairs
   - Redis caching behavior (hit/miss scenarios)
   - Data consistency across pipeline versions
   - Edge cases (missing data, outliers, NaN handling)

2. **ML Model Tests:**
   - Regime detection probability constraints (sum to 1.0, range [0,1])
   - Strategy weight normalization (meta-controller outputs)
   - Online learning weight consolidation (EWC correctness)
   - Model checkpoint loading and versioning

3. **Risk Management Tests:**
   - Position limit enforcement logic (25% concentration)
   - Correlation matrix calculations
   - VaR computation accuracy
   - Portfolio state updates after trades

4. **Event-Driven Tests:**
   - Kafka producer/consumer message serialization
   - Event schema validation (Pydantic models)
   - Circuit breaker state transitions

### Integration Testing
**End-to-End Scenarios:**
1. **Full Trading Cycle:**
   ```
   Market Data → Data Service → Inference Service → Risk Manager → Execution → Forensics
   ```
   - Validate data flows correctly through entire pipeline
   - Confirm Kafka events emitted at each stage
   - Verify TimescaleDB metrics logged
   - Check forensics audit trail completeness

2. **Model Training Integration:**
   - Training Orchestrator queues GPU job → MLflow logs metrics → TimescaleDB stores → Checkpoint saved
   - Validate concurrent training (5+ jobs) without conflicts
   - Confirm automated checkpoint cleanup

3. **Regime Transition Handling:**
   - Smooth strategy weight evolution during regime shifts
   - Verify portfolio disruption <5%
   - Continuous probability blending vs. hard switches

4. **Online Learning Adaptation:**
   - Incremental update triggered → EWC applied → Stability check → MLflow registry updated
   - Automatic rollback on performance degradation

### Performance Testing
**Load Testing (Locust Framework):**
```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class InferenceLoadTest(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(0.1, 0.5)  # 2-10 requests/sec per user

    @task
    def predict(self):
        self.client.post("/api/v1/predict", json={
            "symbol": "AAPL",
            "risk_check": True
        })

# Run with 500 concurrent users = 10k requests/sec peak
# Validate P95 <50ms, P99 <100ms
```

**Benchmark Targets:**
- **Inference Service:** 10k requests/sec sustained for 1 hour, P95 <50ms, P99 <100ms
- **Data Pipeline:** 5k data updates/sec with <200ms end-to-end feature generation
- **TimescaleDB:** 50 concurrent training jobs writing metrics, <10ms write latency P95
- **Kafka Throughput:** 100k forensics events/sec with <5 sec lag

### Stress Testing
**Long-Running Stability:**
- **7-Day Continuous Training:** Memory growth <500MB over 168 hours
- **Database Recovery:** TimescaleDB node failure with automatic failover <30s
- **Cascade Failure:** Kafka outage does not impact trading decision latency
- **Regime Instability:** Rapid regime oscillation (10 switches/hour) maintains stable predictions

### Regression Testing
**Historical Market Scenarios (50+ test cases):**
1. **Bull Market:** Sustained uptrend (2021 tech rally)
2. **Bear Market:** Drawdown period (2022 crypto winter)
3. **Sideways Market:** Range-bound (2015 summer)
4. **Flash Crash:** Rapid volatility spike (May 2010, Feb 2018)
5. **Regime Transitions:** Bull → Bear (COVID crash March 2020)
6. **High Volatility:** Earnings announcements, Fed meetings
7. **Low Liquidity:** After-hours trading, holidays
8. **Correlation Breakdown:** Market stress events

**Validation Criteria:**
- Model behavior consistency across releases
- No performance regressions (Sharpe ratio maintained)
- Risk limits never violated
- Forensics audit trail complete
