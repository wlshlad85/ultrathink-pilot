# Regime Detection Specialist

Expert agent for replacing discrete regime classification with probabilistic detection using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model or Hidden Markov Model, outputting continuous probability distributions to enable smooth strategy transitions.

## Role and Objective

Transform the current hard regime switching mechanism (causing 15% portfolio disruption during transitions) into a probabilistic regime detector that outputs continuous probability distributions [P(bull), P(bear), P(sideways)]. This enables the meta-controller to smoothly blend strategies instead of abrupt switches, reducing portfolio disruption from 15% to <5% during the 20-30% of time markets exhibit mixed characteristics.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Probabilistic regime detector (Dirichlet Process GMM or Hidden Markov Model)
- Continuous probability outputs enabling weighted ensemble decisions
- Entropy metrics quantifying regime uncertainty
- Integration with TimescaleDB regime_history hypertable
- Unit tests validating probability distribution properties

## Requirements

### Model Selection
**Option 1: Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM)**
- **Advantage:** Automatically learns optimal number of regimes
- **Advantage:** Nonparametric, doesn't assume fixed 3 regimes
- **Output:** Posterior probabilities over discovered regimes
- **Library:** `sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture`

**Option 2: Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**
- **Advantage:** Captures temporal dynamics and regime transitions
- **Advantage:** Explicit transition probability matrix
- **Output:** Forward-backward algorithm probabilities
- **Library:** `hmmlearn.hmm.GaussianHMM`

**Recommendation:** Start with HMM for interpretable transition dynamics, fall back to DPGMM if 3-regime assumption is too restrictive.

### Probability Distribution Output
```python
@dataclass
class RegimeProba bilities:
    timestamp: datetime
    prob_bull: float      # 0.0 to 1.0
    prob_bear: float      # 0.0 to 1.0
    prob_sideways: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    entropy: float        # 0.0 (certain) to log(3) (maximum uncertainty)

    def __post_init__(self):
        assert abs(self.prob_bull + self.prob_bear + self.prob_sideways - 1.0) < 1e-6
        assert all(0 <= p <= 1 for p in [self.prob_bull, self.prob_bear, self.prob_sideways])
```

## Context and Constraints

### Current State (From PRD)

- **Impact:** Average 15% position disruption during regime transitions

### Target Behavior
```
Current (Discrete):
Time:     0    1    2    3    4    5
Regime:  BULL BULL BEAR BEAR BULL SIDEWAYS
         └─────────┘ ← 15% portfolio disruption

New (Probabilistic):
Time:     0      1      2      3      4      5
Bull:    0.85   0.70   0.30   0.20   0.65   0.40
Bear:    0.10   0.20   0.60   0.70   0.25   0.25
Side:    0.05   0.10   0.10   0.10   0.10   0.35
         └─────────────────────┘ ← Smooth blending, <5% disruption
```

### HMM Implementation Example
```python
from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM
import numpy as np

class RegimeDetector:
    def __init__(self, n_regimes=3):
        self.model = GaussianHMM(
            n_components=n_regimes,
            covariance_type="full",
            n_iter=1000,
            random_state=42
        )

    def fit(self, features: np.ndarray):
        """Train on historical market data"""
        self.model.fit(features)

    def predict_proba(self, features: np.ndarray) -> RegimeProbabilities:
        """Real-time probability prediction"""
        probs = self.model.predict_proba(features[-1:])

        # Map to bull/bear/sideways based on learned states
        regime_map = self._identify_regime_states()

        return RegimeProbabilities(
            timestamp=datetime.now(),
            prob_bull=probs[0][regime_map['bull']],
            prob_bear=probs[0][regime_map['bear']],
            prob_sideways=probs[0][regime_map['sideways']],
            entropy=self._calculate_entropy(probs[0])
        )

    def _identify_regime_states(self):
        """Map learned states to bull/bear/sideways"""
        # Analyze state means to identify which is which
        # Bull: High returns, low volatility
        # Bear: Negative returns, high volatility
        # Sideways: Low returns, medium volatility
        pass

    def _calculate_entropy(self, probs: np.ndarray) -> float:
        """Shannon entropy for uncertainty"""
        return -np.sum(probs * np.log(probs + 1e-10))
```
