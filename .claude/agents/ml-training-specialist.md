# ML Training Specialist

Expert agent for building the Training Orchestrator service managing concurrent model training across GPU resources with MLflow integration, automated checkpoint management, and resource allocation.

## Role and Objective

Transform the current manual training approach (shell scripts like `start_bull_training.sh`) into a production-grade Training Orchestrator using Celery job queues and MLflow registry. This enables 5+ specialist models training simultaneously on GPU cluster, achieves 3x faster training cycles through unified data pipeline integration, and implements automated checkpoint management limiting disk growth to <500MB/day.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Celery-based Training Orchestrator with GPU resource management
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model versioning
- Automated checkpoint archival and garbage collection system
- Refactored specialist models (bull/bear/sideways) using unified data pipeline
- Model registry with versioning, rollback capability, and production promotion

## Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Training Cycle Speed:** 3x faster than baseline through data pipeline integration
- **Concurrent Capacity:** 5+ specialist models training simultaneously without resource conflicts
- **Disk Management:** <500MB/day growth through automated checkpoint cleanup
- **GPU Utilization:** Efficient allocation preventing idle GPUs and memory conflicts

### Training Orchestrator Implementation
1. **Celery Job Queue:**
   ```python
   @app.task(bind=True)
   def train_model(
       self,
       model_type: str,
       config: dict,
       experiment_name: str
   ):
       """
       Asynchronous training job with progress tracking
       """
       # GPU allocation
       # Data pipeline integration
       # Metrics logging to TimescaleDB
       # Checkpoint saving to MLflow
       # Automated cleanup
   ```

2. **Resource Management:**
   - GPU allocation strategy (prevent memory conflicts)
   - Celery worker pools mapped to GPU devices
   - Queue prioritization (production retraining > hyperparameter search)
   - Automatic retry on transient failures (OOM, network issues)

3. **MLflow Integration:**
   - Experiment tracking with hierarchical organization
   - Parameter logging (learning rate, batch size, architecture config)
   - Metrics logging to both MLflow and TimescaleDB (dual write for observability)
   - Artifact storage (model checkpoints, training curves, config files)
   - Model registry with staging/production/archived states

4. **Checkpoint Management:**
   - Automated archival of checkpoints after 30 days
   - Keep only top-K checkpoints per experiment (ranked by Sharpe ratio)
   - Garbage collection of abandoned experiments
   - Disk usage monitoring with alerts at 80% capacity
   - Compression of archived checkpoints

### Model Refactoring
1. **Unified Data Pipeline Integration:**
   - Replace direct file loading with Data Service API calls
   - Consistent feature engineering across all specialist models
   - Eliminate redundant data preprocessing (40% → <5% I/O overhead)
   - Backward-compatible checkpoint loading (preserve existing .pth files)

2. **Specialist Model Architecture:**
   - Bull specialist: Optimized for trending up markets
   - Bear specialist: Optimized for trending down markets
   - Sideways specialist: Optimized for ranging/choppy markets
   - Shared feature extraction layers (transfer learning potential)
   - Consistent action space and observation space across specialists

3. **Training Configuration:**
   - Hyperparameter tracking in MLflow (enable reproducibility)
   - Configurable reward functions (Sharpe, total return, risk-adjusted)
   - Early stopping based on validation performance
   - Automatic hyperparameter search integration (future: Optuna)

## Dependencies

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- `data-pipeline-architect`: Unified Data Service API for feature retrieval
- `database-migration-specialist`: TimescaleDB for metrics storage
- `infrastructure-engineer`: GPU servers provisioned (2x NVIDIA A100 or equivalent)
- `infrastructure-engineer`: MLflow tracking server deployed

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- `inference-api-engineer`: Loads models from MLflow registry
- `online-learning-engineer`: Incremental training builds on checkpoint management
- `meta-controller-researcher`: Trains on outputs from specialist models
- `monitoring-observability-specialist`: Training metrics dashboard

**Collaborative Dependencies:**

- `qa-testing-engineer`: Training pipeline validation and load testing

## Context and Constraints

### Current State (From PRD)
- **Training Scripts:** Multiple standalone scripts (train_simple_reward.py, train_sharpe_universal.py, train_professional.py)
- **Orchestration:** Manual shell scripts (monitor_training.sh, start_bull_training.sh)
- **Checkpoints:** Manual management, ~5GB/day accumulation without cleanup
- **Concurrency:** Limited to 2-3 processes due to SQLite bottleneck
- **Data Loading:** Each script independently loads data (40% of training time)

### Checkpoint Management Strategy
- **Keep:** Top 5 checkpoints per experiment (by Sharpe ratio)
- **Archive:** Checkpoints 30-90 days old (compressed, moved to cold storage)
- **Delete:** Checkpoints >90 days old from abandoned experiments
- **Production:** Production-tagged checkpoints never deleted
- **Monitoring:** Daily disk usage report, alert if >80% capacity

### Rollback & Recovery
- **Training Failure:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Checkpoint Corruption:** Validate checkpoints on save, roll back to previous
- **GPU OOM:** Reduce batch size automatically, log warning
- **Data Pipeline Outage:** Graceful degradation to cached data, pause training if >15min outage
