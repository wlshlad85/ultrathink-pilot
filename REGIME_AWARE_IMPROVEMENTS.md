# Regime-Aware Model Improvements

## Overview

Based on comprehensive forensics analysis of 640 trading decisions across 2020-2024, we've implemented targeted fixes to address the model's systematic failure patterns.

**Key Finding**: Model doesn't struggle with bear markets (5.4% error) - it struggles with **neutral markets (11.5% error)** and **fighting the trend** (42% of failures).

---

## What's New

### 1. TradingEnvV2 - Regime-Aware Environment

**File**: `rl/trading_env_v2.py`

#### Expanded State Space: 43 → 53 Features

**New Regime Features (5)**:
- `regime_type`: Encoded as 0=bear, 0.5=neutral, 1=bull
- `regime_confidence`: How long we've been in this regime (0-1)
- `regime_duration`: Normalized days in current regime
- `regime_transition_risk`: Instability measure (0-1, higher = more transitions)
- `regime_stability`: Opposite of transition risk

**New Trend Confirmation Features (5)**:
- `trend_50d`: Price distance from SMA50 (normalized)
- `trend_200d`: Price distance from SMA200 (normalized)
- `sma_alignment`: SMA stack alignment score (-1 to +1)
- `price_momentum`: 20-day price momentum
- `volatility_percentile`: Current volatility vs 90-day history

#### Regime-Aware Rewards

**Three new reward components**:

1. **Regime Penalties** (`regime_penalty_weight=0.5`):
   - BUY in bear market: -0.5 penalty
   - BUY in neutral market: -0.2 penalty (addresses 11.5% error rate)
   - HOLD in bear/neutral: +0.1 bonus (encourages capital preservation)
   - SELL in bear with position: +0.3 bonus

2. **Trend Bonuses** (`trend_bonus_weight=0.3`):
   - BUY above SMA50: +0.2 bonus (trend-following)
   - BUY below SMA50: -0.3 penalty (addresses "fighting trend" pattern)

3. **Sell Bonuses** (`sell_bonus_weight=0.2`):
   - SELL at profit: bonus proportional to profit %
   - SELL near peak (within 5%): +0.2 extra bonus

**Rationale**: Forensics showed:
- Old model had only 5% sell rate (should be higher)
- 42% of failures were buying counter-trend
- 11.5% error in neutral markets (vs 5.4% in bear)

## How the Fixes Address Forensics Findings

### Finding 1: Neutral Market Weakness (11.5% Error Rate)

**Problem**: Model misreads regime transitions - sideways consolidation as accumulation when it's actually distribution.

**Solution**:
```python
# NEW: Regime transition detection
regime_transition_risk = (unique_regimes - 1) / 2
regime_stability = 1.0 - regime_transition_risk

# Penalize buying in unstable regimes
if regime == "neutral":
    regime_adjustment = -0.2  # Moderate penalty
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce neutral market error from 11.5% → < 5%

### Finding 2: Fighting The Trend (42% of Failures, $31k Cost)

**Problem**: Model buys when price < SMA50 expecting mean reversion that doesn't come.

**Solution**:
```python
# NEW: Trend confirmation check
if action == BUY:
    if price > sma_50:
        trend_adjustment = +0.2  # Bonus for trend-following
    else:
        trend_adjustment = -0.3  # Penalty for counter-trend
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce "fighting trend" failures from 42% → < 10%

### Finding 3: Underselling (Only 5% Sell Rate)

**Problem**: Model only sells reactively after losses, not proactively for profit-taking.

**Solution**:
```python
# NEW: Profit-taking rewards
if action == SELL and position_value > cost_basis:
    profit_pct = (position_value - cost_basis) / cost_basis
    sell_adjustment = 0.2 * min(profit_pct, 0.5)

# Extra bonus near peak
if current_value > portfolio_peak * 0.95:
    sell_adjustment += 0.2
```

**Expected Impact**: Increase SELL rate from 5% → ~10-15%, especially near peaks

### Finding 4: 2021 Q4 Peak Failure (0 Sells, 20% Error Rate)

**Problem**: Model bought 13 times as BTC fell from $69k → $47k, never sold near the top.

**Solution**:
```python
# Combination of:
1. Regime transition detection (Q4 2021 was neutral → bear transition)
2. Sell bonuses near peaks
3. Penalties for buying in neutral markets with high transition risk
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce Q4 2021 error from 20% → < 8%

  --episodes 1500 \
  --validate-every 50 \
  --device cuda \
  --save-dir rl/models/regime_aware_v1
```

**Training will**:
- Train on 2017-2021 (bull market + COVID crash)
- Validate on 2022 bear market every 100 episodes
- Print "Fighting Trend" rate each validation
- Save best model based on validation return
- Early stop if 3 consecutive validations < -10%

**Expected Training Time**:
- 1000 episodes: ~6-8 hours on GPU, ~20-24 hours on CPU
- Validation adds ~5 min per 100 episodes

### Monitoring Progress

During training, watch for:

1. **"Fighting Trend" Rate**: Should decrease over time
   - Start: ~40-50% (random)
   - Target: < 20%
   - Excellent: < 10%

2. **Validation Return**: Should improve
   - Old model: +1.03% (2022)
   - Target: > +5%
   - Excellent: > +10%

3. **Action Distribution in Bear Market**:
   - Old: 16.5% BUY, 3.3% SELL
   - Target: < 10% BUY, > 8% SELL

### After Training: Run Forensics

## Technical Details

### State Space Comparison

**Old (43 features)**:
```
Portfolio (3) + Indicators (10) + History (30) = 43
```

**New (53 features)**:
```
Portfolio (3) + Indicators (10) + Regime (5) + Trend (5) + History (30) = 53
```

### Regime Detection Algorithm

```python
# Pre-computed during initialization
for idx in range(len(market_data)):
    regime = regime_detector.detect_regime(market_data, idx)
    # Cached for fast lookup during training
    self.regime_cache[idx] = regime
```

**Classification Logic**:
1. Calculate 60-day price momentum
2. Check SMA20 vs SMA50 alignment
3. Check RSI momentum
4. Combine signals to classify as bull/bear/neutral

### Reward Function Formula

```python
total_reward = base_reward + regime_adjustment + trend_adjustment + sell_adjustment

where:
    base_reward = (portfolio_value_change) * reward_scaling
    regime_adjustment = regime_penalty_weight * regime_factor
    trend_adjustment = trend_bonus_weight * trend_factor
    sell_adjustment = sell_bonus_weight * sell_factor
```

### Hyperparameter Recommendations

**Tested values**:
- `regime_penalty_weight`: 0.3-0.7 (default: 0.5)
- `trend_bonus_weight`: 0.2-0.5 (default: 0.3)
- `sell_bonus_weight`: 0.1-0.3 (default: 0.2)

**Guidelines**:
- Higher `regime_penalty_weight` → More conservative in uncertain markets
- Higher `trend_bonus_weight` → More trend-following
- Higher `sell_bonus_weight` → More profit-taking

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Validation return is worse than old model

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check validation details
grep "VALIDATION" rl/models/regime_aware/training.log

# Compare action distributions
# Old model: 16.5% BUY in bear market
# New model should be: < 10% BUY in bear market
```

**Solutions**:
1. Increase `regime_penalty_weight` (try 0.7)
2. Decrease `trend_bonus_weight` (try 0.2)
3. Train longer (try 1500 episodes)

### Issue: "Fighting trend" rate not improving

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check trend penalty is working
python -c "from rl.trading_env_v2 import TradingEnvV2; env = TradingEnvV2(); print('Trend bonus weight:', env.trend_bonus_weight)"
```

**Solutions**:
1. Increase `trend_bonus_weight` (try 0.5)
2. Verify SMA50 values are correct in data
3. Check if model is actually learning (loss decreasing)

### Issue: Model too conservative (too many HOLDs)

**Diagnosis**: If validation shows < 5% BUY rate in all regimes

**Solutions**:
1. Decrease `regime_penalty_weight` (try 0.3)
2. Increase `trend_bonus_weight` (try 0.4)
3. Reduce exploration (decrease entropy_coef in PPOAgent)

## Next Steps After Training

### 1. Run Full Forensics Analysis

```bash
python run_forensics.py --model rl/models/regime_aware/best_model.pth
```

### 2. Compare with Old Model

```bash
# Side-by-side comparison
cd forensics_output
diff <(cat forensics_output_v1/period_comparison.csv) \
     <(cat forensics_output_v2/period_comparison.csv)
```

### 3. Check Specific Improvements

**2021 Q4 (market top)**:
- Did model sell more? (old: 0 sells)
- Lower error rate? (old: 20%)

**2022 Bear Market**:
- Fewer "fighting trend" BUYs? (old: 11 instances)
- Lower total cost? (old: $44,841)

**Neutral Markets**:
- Lower error rate across all periods? (old: 11.5%)

### 4. Deploy if Successful

If all targets met:
```bash
# Copy to production
cp rl/models/regime_aware/best_model.pth rl/models/production/regime_aware_v1.pth

# Document results
echo "Model v1 -> v2 improvements:" > MODEL_CHANGELOG.md
echo "- Neutral market error: 11.5% -> X.X%" >> MODEL_CHANGELOG.md
echo "- Fighting trend failures: 15 -> X" >> MODEL_CHANGELOG.md
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Pre-Compute Regimes?

**Alternative**: Detect regime on-the-fly during training
**Problem**: Expensive (60-day lookback + indicators)
**Solution**: Pre-compute once during __init__, cache results

**Trade-off**: Uses more memory (~1KB per episode) but 10x faster training

### Why Regime Penalties vs Separate Policies?

**Alternative**: Train 3 separate models (one per regime)
**Problem**:
- 3x training time
- Regime transitions unclear
- Previous forensics showed this approach failed

**Solution**: Single model with regime-aware rewards

**Benefits**:
- Model learns smooth regime transitions
- Less training time
- Better generalization

### Why Not Use Regime as Direct Input to Actor?

**Alternative**: Feed regime directly to policy network
**Problem**: Model might ignore regime info

**Solution**: Encode regime in state AND shape rewards

**Benefits**:
- Model sees regime (state features)
- Model is incentivized to use regime (reward shaping)
- Double reinforcement of regime importance
