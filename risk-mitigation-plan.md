## RISK REGISTER

### R001: Online Learning Instability

**Category:** Technical | **Severity:** HIGH | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Incremental model updates via Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) may cause performance degradation or instability due to:
- Catastrophic forgetting of important patterns
- Overfitting to recent data
- Hyperparameter sensitivity

**Impact:**
- Trading performance degrades >30% suddenly
- Model predictions become erratic
- Loss of confidence in system reliability
- Potential financial losses during instability period

**Root Causes:**
1. Learning rate too aggressive (>1e-4)
2. EWC lambda insufficient (regularization too weak)
3. Data distribution shift too rapid
4. Fisher information matrix inaccurate

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Prevention (Before Deployment):**
1. Conservative defaults:
   - Learning rate: 1e-5 (very small)
   - EWC lambda: 1000 (strong regularization)
   - Update frequency: Daily max (not hourly)
2. Extensive validation:
   - Test on 5+ historical regime shifts
   - Measure Sharpe ratio pre/post update
   - Validate with 30-day simulations
3. Stability checks:
   - Automatic rollback if Sharpe drops >30%
   - Performance monitoring every 100 steps
   - Entropy checks for prediction consistency

**Detection (During Operation):**
- **Alert Triggers:**
  - Sharpe ratio drops >30% over 5-day window
  - P95 inference latency increases >2x
  - Prediction variance increases >50%
  - Episode returns become negative consistently
- **Monitoring:**
  - Real-time Sharpe ratio dashboard
  - Model performance by regime
  - Gradient norm tracking (detect exploding gradients)

**Response (If Occurs):**
1. **Immediate (Auto):** Rollback to last stable checkpoint (60 seconds)
2. **Short-term (30 min):** Freeze online learning, switch to static mode
3. **Medium-term (24 hours):** Root cause analysis
   - Analyze update that caused instability
   - Check data distribution shift
   - Review hyperparameters
4. **Long-term (1 week):** Adjust and re-enable with canary
   - Reduce learning rate by 50% (e.g., 1e-5 â†’ 5e-6)
   - Increase EWC lambda by 2x (stronger regularization)
   - Shadow mode testing before re-enable

**Contingency Plan:**
- **Fallback:** Disable online learning entirely, use static retraining
- **Frequency:** Weekly full retraining instead of daily incremental
- **Performance:** Accept 15-25% degradation over 3 months (baseline)
- **Trade-off:** Less adaptive but more stable

**Owner:** online-learning-engineer
**Validation:** ONLINE_LEARNING_VALIDATION.md report required before production

### R002: Inference API Latency Target Unmet

**Category:** Performance | **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
P95 inference latency may exceed 50ms target due to:
- Model complexity (large neural networks)
- Synchronous service calls (Data Service, Regime Detection)
- Network overhead between containers
- GPU inference queue contention

**Impact:**
- Missed trading opportunities (alpha decay)
- Reduced strategy profitability by 2-5%
- Competitive disadvantage vs. institutional platforms
- User dissatisfaction

**Root Causes:**
1. Cold start latency (model not cached)
2. Synchronous blocking I/O
3. Inefficient model serving
4. Network latency between services

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Prevention:**
1. **Early Profiling:** Load test during development (not after integration)
2. **Async I/O:** Use Python asyncio for all service calls
3. **Model Optimization:**
   - Warm model cache on startup (avoid cold starts)
   - Consider model quantization (FP16 vs FP32)
   - Batch inference if applicable
4. **Service Optimization:**
   - Redis caching for feature lookups (90%+ hit rate)
   - Connection pooling (avoid connection overhead)

**Detection:**
- Load test: 10k requests, measure P50/P95/P99
- Monitor: Prometheus histogram `inference_latency_ms`
- Alert: P95 >100ms sustained for 5 minutes

**Response:**
1. **Phase 1 (Identify):** Profile latency bottlenecks
   - Use `py-spy` or `cProfile` for hotspots
   - Check service call timings
   - Measure model inference time
2. **Phase 2 (Optimize):** Target worst bottlenecks
   - Async service calls (biggest impact)
   - Cache optimization (feature lookups)
   - Model optimization (if inference slow)
3. **Phase 3 (Validate):** Re-run load test
   - Measure improvement
   - Iterate if target not met

**Contingency Plan:**
- **Relax Target:** If architecture sound, accept <100ms P95 instead of 50ms
- **Trade-off:** Still 2-5x faster than baseline (200-500ms), acceptable improvement
- **Justification:** Production deployment more important than perfect latency

**Owner:** inference-api-engineer
**Escalation:** Master Orchestrator if optimization unsuccessful

### R003: Meta-Controller Code Quality Issues

**Category:** Technical Debt | **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Existing `/services/meta_controller/` implementation quality unknown:
- May not implement hierarchical RL correctly
- Strategy weight blending logic unclear
- Potential bugs or missing validation
- Documentation gaps

**Impact:**
- Invalid strategy weights (not summing to 1.0)
- Suboptimal portfolio allocation
- Potential rewrite required (time delay)
- Testing delays

**Root Causes:**
1. Code developed in earlier phase without review
2. No unit tests or validation
3. Unclear implementation of options framework

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Prevention:**
1. **Thorough Code Audit (First Task):** meta-controller-researcher reviews all code
2. **Validation Tests:** Check output correctness
   - Weights sum to 1.0
   - No negative weights
   - Sensible strategy allocation
3. **Documentation:** Understand architecture before changes

**Detection:**
- Code audit reveals issues
- Validation tests fail
- Strategy weights invalid during testing

**Response (If Major Issues Found):**
1. **Assess Severity:**
   - Minor bugs: Fix in-place (1-2 days)
   - Major issues: Rewrite module (4-5 days)
2. **Fallback Plan:**
   - Use simple regime-based routing temporarily
   - Hard-coded weights: bull=1.0 (bull regime), bear=1.0 (bear regime), etc.
   - Deploy Wave 1-2 without meta-controller optimization
3. **Phased Approach:**
   - Deploy basic functionality first
   - Add meta-controller optimization in Wave 4 (post-production)

**Contingency Plan:**
- **Simplified Approach:** Skip hierarchical RL initially
- **Use Regime-Based Routing:** Deterministic strategy selection
- **Performance:** Still achieves <5% disruption via probabilistic regime detection
- **Future Enhancement:** Add meta-controller after system stabilizes

**Owner:** meta-controller-researcher
**Decision Point:** After code audit (Week 3, Day 8)
