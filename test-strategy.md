# Trading System Architectural Enhancement - Test Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Draft
**Implementation Plan:** [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md)

---

## Test Overview

Comprehensive testing approach for Trading System Architectural Enhancement covering unit, integration, performance, and acceptance testing.

---

## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
- Data pipeline feature engineering functions with known input/output pairs
- Regime detection model probability distribution validation (sums to 1.0)
- Strategy weight normalization and constraint validation
- Risk manager position limit enforcement logic
- Online learning weight consolidation regularization
- Model checkpoint loading and versioning
- Kafka producer/consumer message serialization

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end data flow from market data to trading decision
- Model training with TimescaleDB experiment logging
- Inference service with risk manager approval workflow
- Forensics event production and asynchronous consumption
- Meta-controller strategy selection with multiple specialist models
- Online learning incremental update with checkpoint saving
- A/B testing framework with traffic splitting

### End-to-End Tests
- Full trading cycle: market data → features → prediction → risk check → execution → forensics
- Parallel model training with concurrent TimescaleDB writes
- Regime transition handling with smooth strategy weight evolution
- Online learning adaptation to simulated market regime shift
- System recovery from Kafka broker failure
- Rollback procedure from new system to old system
- Risk limit violation triggering automatic position closure

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Training pipeline 3x faster than baseline (validated with 10 runs)
- Regime transition portfolio disruption <5% (measured over 100 transitions)
- TimescaleDB supporting 20 concurrent writes with <10ms P95 latency
- Trading decision latency <50ms P95 (measured over 10k decisions)
- Online learning performance degradation <5% over 30 days (3 regime environments)
- Risk concentration limits never exceeded during 60 days of backtesting
- Zero data inconsistencies between old and new pipelines (1M samples compared)

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Load Testing
- **inference_service:** 10k requests/sec sustained for 1 hour, P95 <50ms, P99 <100ms
- **data_pipeline:** 5k data updates/sec with <200ms end-to-end feature generation
- **timescaledb:** 50 concurrent training jobs writing metrics, <10ms write latency P95
- **kafka_throughput:** 100k forensics events/sec with <5 sec lag

### Stress Testing
- **memory_stability:** 7-day continuous training without memory growth >500MB
- **database_recovery:** TimescaleDB node failure with automatic failover <30s
- **cascade_failure:** Kafka outage does not impact trading decisions latency
- **regime_instability:** Rapid regime oscillation (10 switches/hour) maintains stable predictions

---

## Test Data Requirements

3 years historical market data (2022-2024) with 1-minute bars, covering bull/bear/sideways regimes, including 2 flash crashes and 3 major regime shifts

---

## Test Automation

### Coverage Goals
- **target:** 85% code coverage minimum, 95% for critical path (trading decision flow, risk management)

### CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions pipeline: unit tests on every commit, integration tests on PR, full E2E tests nightly, load tests weekly

---

## Quality Gates

- No P0/P1 bugs in production
- P95 latency SLA met for 99.5% of hours
- Zero risk limit violations not caught by risk manager
- Model performance within 10% of backtested expectations

---

## Test Environment

Staging environment mirroring production with 1/10th scale (1 GPU, smaller DB, single Kafka broker), using anonymized market data

---

## Regression Testing

Maintain test suite of 50 historical market scenarios (regime transitions, flash crashes, trending/ranging) to validate model behavior consistency across releases
