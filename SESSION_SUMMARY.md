- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Gamma: 0.99
- Max episodes: 100
- Status: ðŸ”„ Running in background
- All metrics logging to database automatically

## ðŸš€ HOW TO USE

### Run New Experiments
```bash
# Basic training with defaults
python train_with_logging.py

# With custom hyperparameters
python train_with_logging.py --name "HighLR_Experiment" --lr 0.0005 --gamma 0.95 --episodes 200

# Multiple experiments to compare
python train_with_logging.py --name "Exp1_Baseline" --lr 0.0003 --gamma 0.99
python train_with_logging.py --name "Exp2_HighLR" --lr 0.0005 --gamma 0.99
python train_with_logging.py --name "Exp3_LowGamma" --lr 0.0003 --gamma 0.95
```

### Query Experiments
```bash
# Interactive query tool
python query_experiments.py

# Direct SQL queries
python query_experiments.py "SELECT * FROM experiments ORDER BY best_test_sharpe DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Show all experiments
python query_experiments.py "SELECT * FROM experiment_summary;"

# Compare hyperparameters
python query_experiments.py "SELECT name, learning_rate, gamma, best_test_sharpe FROM experiments;"
```

### Analyze Trained Models
```bash
# Analyze regime-conditional behavior
python analyze_professional.py

# Evaluate on held-out set (ONLY when ready for deployment!)
python evaluate_professional.py
```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ EXAMPLE QUERIES

### Find Best Performing Experiments
```sql
SELECT
    name,
    learning_rate,
    gamma,
    best_test_sharpe,
    best_test_return
FROM experiments
WHERE best_test_sharpe > 0
ORDER BY best_test_sharpe DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Episode-by-Episode Progress
```sql
SELECT
    episode_num,
    train_return,
    test_sharpe,
    is_best_model
FROM episodes
WHERE experiment_id = 1
ORDER BY episode_num;
```

### Compare Multiple Runs
```sql
SELECT
    e.name,
    e.learning_rate,
    e.gamma,
    COUNT(ep.id) as num_episodes,
    e.best_test_sharpe,
    e.early_stopped
FROM experiments e
LEFT JOIN episodes ep ON e.id = ep.experiment_id
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY e.best_test_sharpe DESC;
```

## ðŸŽ“ KEY INSIGHTS FROM TODAY

### Training Results Analysis
We ran two 300-episode training sessions:

**Run 1 (Earlier)**: +5.03% return
- BUY probability: 42.1% (bull) vs 1.8% (bear) â†’ 40.3% difference
- Behavior: Aggressive in bulls, defensive in bears
- SELL usage: 0% (never sold)

**Run 2 (Most Recent)**: -5.53% return
- BUY probability: 50.8% (bull) vs 4.0% (bear) â†’ **46.8% difference** âœ¨
- SELL probability: 38.2% (bear) vs 12.1% (bull) â†’ **26.1% difference** âœ¨
- Behavior: STRONGER regime awareness, but poor timing
- **Learned to SELL!** But sold too early

**Takeaway**: Strong regime awareness doesn't automatically mean good returns.
Timing matters! This is WHY we need systematic hyperparameter search.

## ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Currently Running)
1. âœ… Experiment 1 running with baseline hyperparameters
2. ðŸ“‹ After completion: Run 2-3 more experiments with different settings
3. ðŸ“‹ Query database to compare all results
4. ðŸ“‹ Find optimal hyperparameters based on data

### Short Term (After Database Experiments)
1. ðŸ“‹ Install Plotting MCP for visualization
2. ðŸ“‹ Plot training curves from database
3. ðŸ“‹ Visualize regime behavior across experiments
4. ðŸ“‹ Install GitHub MCP for version control

### Long Term (After Tool Integration)
1. ðŸ“‹ Run comprehensive hyperparameter grid search
2. ðŸ“‹ Systematic comparison of all configurations
3. ðŸ“‹ Select best model based on data
4. ðŸ“‹ Final evaluation on held-out set
5. ðŸ“‹ Deploy to paper trading if successful

## ðŸ’¡ WHY THIS MATTERS

### Before Today
- Results lost in terminal output
- Manual tracking in JSON files
- Hard to compare experiments
- Hyperparameter tuning was guesswork

### After Today
- **Every experiment tracked systematically**
- **SQL queries for instant comparisons**
- **Data-driven hyperparameter selection**
- **Never lose results again**
- **Ready for visualization and version control**

This is professional ML engineering, not ad-hoc experimentation.
