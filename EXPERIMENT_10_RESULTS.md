## ⚠️ Issues Discovered

### Critical Issue: Validation Did Not Execute

**Problem**: Training completed all 1000 episodes, but validation and test phases did not run.

**Evidence**:
- ❌ No `val_return` metrics in database
- ❌ No `test_return` metrics in database
- ❌ Experiment status still "running" (should be "completed")
- ❌ No end_time recorded

**Impact**:
- Cannot assess generalization to unseen data (2022)
- Cannot evaluate performance on recent market (2023-2024)
- Unknown if model overfitted to training data

**Root Cause (Suspected)**:
- Similar issue occurred with Experiment #9
- Likely crash/exception during validation phase
- Experiment cleanup code not executing

**Fix Applied**:
The bug was fixed in train_professional.py (lines 373, 433). The policy returns a tuple (action_probs, state_value) but the code was only unpacking the first value, causing torch.argmax() to fail.

**Manual Validation Results** (Run on 2025-10-20):
- Validation (2022): **+0.00%** - Agent held cash, made no trades
- Test (2023-2024): **+0.00%** - Agent held cash, made no trades
- Note: Overly conservative behavior indicates need for hyperparameter tuning or reward shaping

## 💬 Discussion

### Questions for Investigation
1. Why does validation consistently fail after training completes?
2. What market conditions led to the +9.31% best episode?
3. How does performance compare on different market regimes?
4. Would ensemble of multiple checkpoints improve stability?

### Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: Fix validation bug before next training run
2. **Analysis**: Run Jupyter notebook to visualize learning dynamics
3. **Comparison**: Compare with Experiment #9 (similar performance)
4. **Deployment**: Consider paper trading with best checkpoint
