- ✅ **GPU acceleration confirmed** - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 detected and used
- ✅ RL training successful - Trained 2 episodes, saved model, proper CUDA usage

**Bugs Found & Documented:**

#### 🔴 Critical Bugs
1. **WSL UNC Path Handling** - Subprocess calls fail with `\\wsl.localhost\...` paths
2. **Empty Equity DataFrame** - Crashes when skip_days >= data points

#### 🟡 Moderate Bugs
3. **Missing Gymnasium Dependency** - Not in requirements.txt but required

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue #1: WSL Path Handling
**Impact:** Agent pipeline and orchestration tests fail

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Option A: Run from native WSL bash (not Windows Python)
cd /home/rich/ultrathink-pilot  # Not \\wsl.localhost\...
python run_backtest.py ...

# Option B: Use absolute paths for agent scripts (recommended fix)
```

**Fix in progress:** Modify subprocess calls to use absolute paths

### Issue #2: Short Date Ranges
**Impact:** Backtest fails if skip_days >= data points

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Always provide appropriate skip_days for your date range
python run_backtest.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-02-01 --skip-days 10
```

**Fix in progress:** Add validation and better error messages

### Issue #3: Missing Gymnasium
**Impact:** RL tests fail on fresh install

**Workaround:**
```bash
pip install gymnasium matplotlib
```

**Fix in progress:** Update requirements.txt to mark as required
