## Key Architectural Improvements

Based on the analysis, the specifications address 7 critical weaknesses:

### 1. Unified Data Pipeline (Phase 1 Priority)
**Problem:** 40% of training time wasted on redundant I/O, 3x slower cycles
**Solution:** Centralized Data Service with Redis cache (90%+ hit rate)
**Impact:** 3x faster training, <5% time on I/O, consistent features

### 2. Probabilistic Regime Detection (Phase 2)
**Problem:** Hard regime switches cause 15% portfolio disruption during transitions
**Solution:** Continuous probability distribution [P(bull), P(bear), P(sideways)]
**Impact:** <5% portfolio disruption, smooth strategy weighting

### 3. TimescaleDB Migration (Phase 1 Priority)
**Problem:** SQLite write locks limit concurrent experiments to 2-3 processes
**Solution:** TimescaleDB cluster supporting 20+ concurrent writers
**Impact:** 10x experiment throughput, <10ms P95 write latency

### 4. Event-Driven Forensics (Phase 3)
**Problem:** Synchronous forensics adds 200-500ms latency to trading decisions
**Solution:** Kafka-based async processing, forensics off critical path
**Impact:** Trading decisions <50ms, 4-10x latency reduction

### 5. Hierarchical RL Meta-Controller (Phase 3)
**Problem:** Rigid regime-based routing, no learned strategy selection
**Solution:** Meta-controller learns to blend specialists vs hard-coded rules
**Impact:** Adaptive strategy mix, eliminates discontinuities

### 6. Online Learning Pipeline (Phase 3)
**Problem:** Static models degrade 15-25% over 3 months
**Solution:** Incremental updates with elastic weight consolidation (EWC)
**Impact:** <5% degradation with daily updates, automatic stability checks

### 7. Risk Management Layer (Phase 4)
**Problem:** No portfolio-level risk controls, concentration violations possible
**Solution:** Hierarchical risk parity with real-time position limits
**Impact:** 25% max concentration enforced, correlation tracking, VaR monitoring

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Critical Risks
1. **Model Performance Regression** (Medium/High)
   - Mitigation: Parallel operation, A/B testing, instant rollback capability
   - Validation: Shadow mode for 2 weeks before canary

2. **Data Pipeline Feature Leakage** (Medium/Critical)
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests, automated lookahead detection
   - Validation: Compare 1M samples old vs new pipeline

3. **Online Learning Instability** (Medium-High/High)
   - Mitigation: Conservative learning rates, automatic stability checks
   - Validation: Sharpe ratio monitoring with <30% degradation threshold

4. **Database Migration Data Loss** (Low/Critical)
   - Mitigation: Full backup, dual-write validation, data integrity checks
   - Validation: Checksum comparison of 10k experiments

### Rollback Triggers
- Sharpe ratio drops >30% vs old system (5-day window)
- P95 latency exceeds 200ms for 15+ minutes
- System crashes/restarts >3 times in 24 hours
- Risk limit violations >2 in single trading session

## Technical Highlights

### Microservices Architecture
```
Market Data → Data Service (Redis) → Inference Service → Risk Manager → Execution
                                          ↓
                                    Kafka Events
                                          ↓
                                  Forensics Consumer
```

### Data Models
- **TimescaleDB:** Experiment tracking, regime history (hypertables)
- **Kafka:** Trading decisions, model updates (event sourcing)
- **Redis:** Feature cache, 5-minute TTL (90%+ hit rate target)
- **Risk State:** In-memory portfolio metrics (10ms P95 validation)

### APIs
- `GET /api/v1/features/{symbol}/{timeframe}` - Feature retrieval (P95 <20ms)
- `POST /api/v1/predict` - Trading signal generation (P95 <50ms)
- `POST /api/v1/risk/check` - Risk validation (P95 <10ms)
- `GET /api/v1/forensics/{decision_id}` - Explainability (P95 <500ms)

### Failure Modes Covered
1. TimescaleDB connection failure → local file fallback
2. Kafka broker unavailable → in-memory buffering (10k events)
3. Meta-controller invalid weights → automatic normalization
4. Online learning instability → automatic rollback (<60 sec)
5. Feature leakage detection → immediate trading halt
6. Redis cache eviction → direct computation fallback
